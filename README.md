üèõ Municipality App: Local Events & Citizen Engagement

üåü Project Summary

The Municipality App is an ASP.NET Core MVC (C#) application focused on efficient citizen engagement and local information access.

The core of the project is a high-performance system for managing local events and announcements. It achieves superior speed and responsiveness by leveraging advanced C# data structures for all search, sorting, and personalization features.

‚ú® Core Features

Events List: Displays all local events with robust search, filtering, and sorting options.

Personalized Recommendations: Uses a Content-Based Algorithm to suggest events based on tracked user interest.

Recently Viewed: Tracks the last events a user viewed for quick access (implemented with a Stack).

Issue Reporting: Placeholder feature for citizens to report municipal issues.

üõ† Technical Implementation & Data Structures

This project is built around specialized C# generic collections for optimal performance:

Feature/Task

Data Structure Used

Purpose & Benefit

Primary Event Storage

SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<Event>>

Maintains events in automatic chronological order for efficient retrieval.

Filtering & Lookup

HashSet<string> (Categories)

Provides O(1) lookup for unique category lists, ensuring fast filter population.

Last Viewed History

Stack<Event>

Implements Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) behavior for accurate history tracking.

Recommendation Engine

Dictionary<string, int> (Interest Scores)

Tracks user interaction frequency to determine personalized priority scores.

Recommendation Algorithm

Content-Based Filtering

Scores and sorts events by user interest frequency before date.
